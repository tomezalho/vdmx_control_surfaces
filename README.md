# Samson Conspiracy MIDI controller
Complete 1:1 layout and MIDI map.
Notes:
- The infinity knob encoders are all smoothed with NumFX, to prevent small value jumps.
- The XY pad snaps to marks at 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 value on both axis and is smoothed with NumFX. The amount of smoothness and proximity sensitivity can be adjusted with non-mapped sliders in the layout.
- The crossfader is likewise marked and smoothed out, with options for smoothness and snapping.
